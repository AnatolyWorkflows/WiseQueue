General Info
--------------

The project is being created using most effective approaches to software development including latest technologies, powerful methodology and best ideas from different systems designed to manage tasks. With **WiseQueue** you will get a unified application that will provide a simple way to create tasks using **Fire-And-Forget** or **Fire-And-WaitResponse** depending on your needs. 

The application will have support for delayed start of tasks, running tasks according to schedules and running tasks when event happens. Make the most of today while being prepared for the future!

The system will have user friendly interface which will allow you to control and manage tasks’ and servers’ statuses. For instance, you will be able to add more threads(processes) to handle your tasks both automatically and via UI. The client-side will be done using HTML and AngularJS. Server-side will use WebApi+Json. Given that developers will be able to seamlessly integrate the system into their applications.

Great features of WiseQueue
----------------------------

With **WiseQueue** you will be able to program and automate processes in your own fashion to create unique control over your data, administration, and reports:

1. Create tasks and distribute them with ease
2. Track progress of tasks
3. Send messages to individuals or even groups
4. Choose to have messages and tasks scheduled for a future date
5. Use templates crafted for straightforward and effective communication

Technologies
-------------

The first version of application will support both relational and NoSQL databases. I selected MS SQL and MongoDB for now. However, I am developing a scalable application and due to architectural decisions adding new databases will be a simple task. So in the future releases I am planning to add support of DynamoDB, MySQL, Redis and others.
